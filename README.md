Slides and a script for a presentation on Packaging and sustainability

## Slide 1
This is a general introduction to a few key things about package design as well as to sustainability (generally; and how to apply that to your designing).

Packaging is about more than just the boxes things come in; and its about more than putting pretty labels on things.

You have to think about the Aesthetics and Style, sure. But you also have to think about the materials involved; how this ting is sold; who is it for; why is it necessary; and then you have to think about logisitcs: how does it get shipped or transported or distributed/delivered? Is it sold in a store? online? How do people use and open this; etc.

## This makes packaging design a complex, multi-faceted enterprise.
So; it's a lot! It helps to try and take a "systems" approach to this

Try to see all the potential bits and pieces of a project at the outset and then design accordingly.

If you're trying to grasp this; here's a venn diagram: what package designing "is" is the overlap of all these different things -- you take them into account; 

## Packaging does not require paragraph
Packaging does not require you to be experts in every point of minutia. It simply demands that you know which questions to ask, who to seek for answers, and what to do with the answers when you get them. (in fact; design in general; while complicated; doesn't ask that you are an expert in everything, but just that you know the experts to ask!)

Whew.

## Is a package even necessary?
Don't forget to ask the reall important quesion -- do we even need to do this project?

Maybe the above should go in a new section; not at the beginning?

## 1 - what are we talking about when we talk about packaging design?
There is retail packaging; wholesale packaging; primary packaging; secondary packaging; tertiary packaging; plastic; paper; sterile; minimal; maximal; excessive; functional; ceremonial; carefree; frustrating; etc. The list goes on.

Show a primary/convenience image? something else comparative?

## Primary Packaging
Primary packaging is the material closest to the product

70% of purchasing decisions are made at the store. This is why packaging is an important task.

## Examples
Here are a small handful of examples.

(show many samples; probably need more; and should try to find the urls they came from? [maybe I can setup an are.na collection to 
find some sources])

## Packaging/Branding
A little side note; as you can see from a lot of these examples, packaging decisions are often related to branding decisions. If you 
are a progressive brand; or you are an innovative brand; you might want to find a way to do progressive or innovative packaging! And 
coming up with a specific way to package a more or less mundane product can be an important part of the brand moving forward. (Bon Ami 
labels? IKEA? Tiffany's?)

## II - Packaging's Goals
What are the main aims of Packaging?

Protect; Inform; Sell.

## Protect
Protecting both the product itself; but also the consumer. A package should help stop theft, tampering with a product, impact, shock, 
crushing... it might keep something free of pathogens and dirt and grime; it might just keep it dry or whatever (protection from the 
environment)... Basically its the clothes or armor around the thing you actually want the consumer to get. whatever form that takes 
(side note: you could also think about things like DRM as forms of packaging "protection" -- but in that case they are protecting the 
publisher; not the consumer.)

## Inform
A package should also inform about the product itself, about the brand/company at large, perhaps about the greater group of objects 
this thing belongs in/with, maybe other general concerns -- danger/health/safety/etc.

## Sell
A package is a billboard for what is inside. It is partially meant to entice and convince a person to buy it over the other things 
around it. It should sell the interior contents; it should inspire brand loyalty;
