Slides and a script for a presentation on Packaging and sustainability

## Slide 1

This is a general introduction to package design, and a little sustainability (generally; and how to apply them to your designing).

So first, some packaging.

Packaging is about more than just the boxes things come in; and its about more than putting pretty labels on things.

You have to think about the Aesthetics and Style, sure. But you also have to think about the materials involved; how this thing is sold; who is it for; why is it necessary; what is it really? and then you have to think about logisitcs: how does it get shipped or transported or distributed/delivered? Is it sold in a store? online? How do people use and open this; etc. Woah.

## This makes packaging design a complex, multi-faceted enterprise.

So; it's a lot! It helps to try and take a "systems" approach to this. The systems thinking stuff is gonna come back; I promise.

The short of it is that you must Try to see all the potential bits and pieces of a project at the outset and then design accordingly. That's systems -- understanding that everything is connected. "If you want to bake an apple pie from scratch you must first invent the universe..." -- carl sagan.

## venn diagram

If you're trying to grasp this; here's a venn diagram: what package designing "is" is the overlap of all these different things -- you take them into account; Packaging design; or at least good (and sustainable) packaging design is where they all meet...

Packaging does not require you to be experts in every point of minutia. It simply demands that you know which questions to ask, who to seek for answers, and what to do with the answers when you get them. (in fact; design in general; while complicated; doesn't ask that you are an expert in everything, but just that you know the experts to ask!)

## 1 - what are we talking about when we talk about packaging design?

There is retail packaging; wholesale packaging; primary packaging; secondary packaging; tertiary packaging; plastic; paper; sterile; minimal; maximal; excessive; functional; ceremonial; carefree; frustrating; etc. The list goes on.

Show a primary/convenience image? something else comparative?

## Primary Packaging

Primary packaging is the material closest to the product

70% of purchasing decisions are made at the store. This is why packaging is an important task.

## Examples

Here are a small handful of examples.

(show many samples; probably need more; and should try to find the urls they came from? [maybe I can setup an are.na collection to find some sources])

## Packaging/Branding

A little side note; as you can see from a lot of these examples, packaging decisions are often related to branding decisions. If you are a progressive brand; or you are an innovative brand; you might want to find a way to do progressive or innovative packaging! And coming up with a specific way to package a more or less mundane product can be an important part of the brand moving forward. (Bon Ami labels? IKEA? Tiffany's?)

## II - Packaging's Goals

What are the main aims of Packaging?

Protect; Inform; Sell.

## Protect

Protecting both the product itself; but also the consumer. A package should help stop theft, tampering with a product, impact, shock, crushing... it might keep something free of pathogens and dirt and grime; it might just keep it dry or whatever (protection from the environment)... Basically its the clothes or armor around the thing you actually want the consumer to get. whatever form that takes (side note: you could also think about things like DRM as forms of packaging "protection" -- but in that case they are protecting the publisher; not the consumer.)

## Inform

A package should also inform about the product itself, about the brand/company at large, perhaps about the greater group of objects this thing belongs in/with, maybe other general concerns -- danger/health/safety/etc.

## Sell

A package is a billboard for what is inside. It is partially meant to entice and convince a person to buy it over the other things around it. It should sell the interior contents; it should inspire brand loyalty;

What is the potato packaging doing there?

What about the logitech stuff?

## Barrier?

Packaging can be a bridge or a barrier to consumers

Packaging is a barrier ... a boundary between the product and externalities. Regulatory, workplace, competitive, marketplace, consumer, cultural, physical, economic, biosphere... they cover the gamute of protection issues, information issues, and commercial issues...

If the externalities change, so must the packaging.

Systems again?

Design of the package as a system occurs when the perspectives of others are included and the life-cycle is considered

Design the process. Design the system. Don't just decorate the product

## III - Packaging Philosophy

The nested circles thing?

Form, content, context???

Packging is the backbone of today's free market system

Packaging Design is a complex balance of economy and ecology; between user and producer; bewteen profit and benefit; between promise and expectation...

Everything is connected

SYSTEMS!

## IV Sustainability?

We've gotten to a lot of packaging related thoughts; and hit on this systems thinking thing a few times now... my main interest is in sustainability. And what I mean by that is design that aids in the welfare of all life. So, if you care about reducing impact; on reusing and recycling; on generally regenerating life instead of eradicating it; you might think a but differently about packaging.

## The most sustainable package is no package...

- The potato sack that degrades?
- Tomorrow machine?
- Bananas?

## Is a package even necessary?

Don't forget to ask the real important quesion -- do we even need to do this project?

## Biomicmry?

So, if a package is supposed to protect, inform, and sell -- does nature do this already with its items? Take a banana: a banana comes packed in large bundles. Each is individually wrapped/protected. They are all signs for themselves -- a banana through color and shape tells you what it is; and the package is usually frustration free; its then fully a biological nutrient afterward... waste = food...

Any other examples like that???
