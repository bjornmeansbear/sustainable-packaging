Slides and a script for a presentation on Packaging and sustainability

## Slide 1
This is a general introduction to a few key things about package design as well as to sustainability (generally; and how to apply that to your designing).

Packaging is about more than just the boxes things come in; and its about more than putting pretty labels on things.

You have to think about the Aesthetics and Style, sure. But you also have to think about the materials involved; how this ting is sold; who is it for; why is it necessary; and then you have to think about logisitcs: how does it get shipped or transported or distributed/delivered? Is it sold in a store? online? How do people use and open this; etc.

## This makes packaging design a complex, multi-faceted enterprise.
So; it's a lot! It helps to try and take a "systems" approach to this

Try to see all the potential bits and pieces of a project at the outset and then design accordingly. 

If you're trying to grasp this; here's a venn diagram: what package designing "is" is the overlap of all these different things -- you 
take them into account; and 

Packaging does

Whew.
